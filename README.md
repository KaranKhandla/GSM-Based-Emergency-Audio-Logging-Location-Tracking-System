# GSM-Based-Emergency-Audio-Logging-Location-Tracking-System
Developed a real-time emergency alert system using an nordmcu with sim networks and wifi also.
Developed a real-time emergency alert system using an ESP32 and GSM module. When the emergency trigger is pressed, the device automatically records audio using an INMP441 microphone and stores it on an SD card. Simultaneously, the SIMCOM A7672S module retrieves the device’s cell-tower-based latitude and longitude. Both the audio file and location data are uploaded to a cloud server for remote monitoring. Designed custom prototype wiring, integrated power regulation, and implemented reliable communication and data handling in firmware.
